I am a Senior research fellow at IIT Bhubaneswar; working tropical cyclone intensification processes and air-sea interaction using coupled
atmospheric-ocean-wave coupled model (COAWST). I am interested particularly in tropical cyclone inner core
evolution, asymmetric convection, intensity variability.

Research Interests
======
- Air-sea interaction
- Tropical cyclone
